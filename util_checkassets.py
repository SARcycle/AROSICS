"""
This script is designed to work with Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Google Drive. It authenticates GEE and Google Drive, lists assets from a GEE collection, extracts timestamps from filenames, identifies missing timestamps based on a specified date range, and optionally exports the missing timestamps to a CSV fil


Modules Used

    import ee: Google Earth Engine API for interacting with GEE resources.
    import os: Module for interacting with the operating system, particularly for directory and file operations.
    import re: Regular expressions module for string pattern matching and extraction.
    import datetime and import timedelta: Modules for handling dates and time arithmetic.
    import pandas as pd: Pandas library, commonly used for data manipulation (imported but not used in this script).
    import csv: Module for CSV file operations.
    from pydrive.auth import GoogleAuth: Google Drive authentication module.
    from oauth2client.service_account import ServiceAccountCredentials: OAuth2 credentials for authenticating service accounts.

Functions

    initialize_gee_and_drive(credentials_file)
        Initializes Google Earth Engine and Google Drive authentication using the provided service account credentials.
        Args:
            credentials_file (str): Path to the service account credentials JSON file.
        Returns:
            True if initialization is successful, False otherwise.
    list_assets(path)
        Lists assets in the specified GEE collection.
        Args:
            path (str): The path to the GEE collection.
        Returns:
            A list of assets in the collection.
    extract_timestamps(directory_path, start_date, end_date)
        Extracts timestamps from filenames in the specified directory that match a specific pattern and are within the given date range.
        Args:
            directory_path (str): The path to the directory containing the files.
            start_date (str): The start date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
            end_date (str): The end date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
        Returns:
            A list of timestamps extracted from the filenames.
    find_missing_assets(source_timestamps, asset_names)
        Identifies timestamps that are present in the source_timestamps but missing from the asset_names list.
        Args:
            source_timestamps (list): List of timestamps to check.
            asset_names (list): List of asset names containing dates.
        Returns:
            A sorted list of missing timestamps.
    doy_to_date(doy, year=2023)
        Converts a day-of-year (DOY) to a date for the specified year.
        Args:
            doy (int): The day of the year (1-365).
            year (int): The year for the conversion (default is 2023).
        Returns:
            A datetime object representing the date.
    export_to_csv(missing_numbers, filename)
        Exports a list of missing timestamps to a CSV file.
        Args:
            missing_numbers (list): List of missing timestamps.
            filename (str): The name of the CSV file to create.
        Returns:
            None.

Usage

    Initialization:
        The script starts by initializing GEE and Google Drive authentication using the provided credentials file.

    Asset Listing:
        It lists all assets in the specified GEE collection path.

    Timestamp Extraction:
        Timestamps are extracted from files in the specified directory that match the date range.

    Finding Missing Assets:
        The script checks if there are any timestamps missing between the source files and the GEE assets.

    Exporting Missing Assets:
        If any timestamps are missing, they are exported to a CSV file.

    Output:
        The script outputs a message indicating whether synchronization is "OK" or "NOT OK" based on the presence of missing assets.

Example:
    $ python util_checkassets.py

    Ensure to update the 'credentials_file' and "data_path" and 'collection_path' variables accordingly.
